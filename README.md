## Example

Assuming that you have a file `foo.tex` in your current working directory that you want to convert into a PDF `foo.pdf`:

**Mac/Linux**

```bash
docker run --rm -t --user="$(id -u):$(id -g)" --net=none -v "$(pwd):/tmp" leplusorg/latex latexmk -outdir=/tmp -pdf /tmp/foo.tex
```

**Windows**

In `cmd`:

```batch
docker run --rm -t --net=none -v "%cd%:/tmp" leplusorg/latex latexmk -outdir=/tmp -pdf /tmp/foo.tex
```

In PowerShell:

```pwsh
docker run --rm -t --net=none -v "${PWD}:/tmp" leplusorg/latex latexmk -outdir=/tmp -pdf /tmp/foo.tex
```

## Help

To know more command-line options of `latexmk`:

```bash
docker run --rm --net=none leplusorg/latex latexmk -h
```

## texlive vs texlive-full

Version 1 of this image was using the
[texlive-full](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=texlive-full&searchon=names&exact=1&suite=all&section=all)
debian package to include as much TeX Live packages pre-installed as
possible. But the resulting docker image was over 4 GB making it slow
to download and breaking some CI/CD disk limits (including the free
tier of GitHub Actions that I use). To keep the image usable by as many
people as possible, I decided with version 2 and above to switch
to the default
[texlive](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=texlive&searchon=names&exact=1&suite=all&section=all)
package.

If you need more TeX Live packages, you have the following options:
- use version 1 of this docker image (i.e. leplusorg/latex:1).
- use the image this fork is based on (i.e. aergus/latex).

## Request new tool

Please use [this link](https://github.com/leplusorg/docker-latex/issues/new?assignees=thomasleplus&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BFEAT%5D) (GitHub account required) to request that a new tool be added to the image. I am always interested in adding new capabilities to these images.
